# System Introduction:
***This system was primarily developed for personal use to share a single FRPS server with several friends, and may not meet all requirements.***
The FRP webManager is an open-source multi-user management platform for FRP penetration. It provides web-based visual configuration and automated client deployment capabilities. Users can self-service create tunnel rules via the web interface, monitor traffic and connection status in real-time, and automatically configure connections using client software. Administrators can globally manage port allocation, detect conflicts, and control user permissions.  *(If using a cloud server, please open firewall ports yourself).*
